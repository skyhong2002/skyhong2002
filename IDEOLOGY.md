## Ideology

### Arts

Most of my Ideology was built by many things, and most of them are from many types of art. I believe that "We are what we see", so I will list some of the things that I have seen and impacted me.

You can see the full list in `Logging / Reviews of Arts` session from `INTERESTS.md` file.
