## Ideology

### Arts

My ideology is shaped by many things, primarily various forms of art. I believe that "We are what we see", so I will list some of the things that I have seen and that have impacted me.

You can see the full list in the `Logging / Reviews of Arts` section from the `INTERESTS.md` file.
